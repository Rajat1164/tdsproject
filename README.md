Data Collection Process

In my data collection process, I utilized Python scripts within Visual Studio Code (VS Code) to efficiently download and manage data. The primary objective was to gather relevant data and store it in CSV files for further analysis.

#### Step 1: Setting Up the Environment

I began by setting up my Python environment in VS Code, ensuring that all necessary libraries, such as requests for making API calls and pandas for data manipulation, were installed. This setup enabled me to write clean and organized scripts.

#### Step 2: Data Downloading

Using Python scripts, I connected to various APIs to retrieve user and repository data. The scripts were structured to:

1. Make HTTP GET requests to the specified endpoints.
2. Parse the JSON responses.
3. Extract relevant fields, such as user IDs, usernames, repository names, and creation dates.

The data collected was then organized and saved into two CSV files: users.csv and repositories.csv. I employed the pandas library to create DataFrames from the extracted data, making it straightforward to export this information as CSV files.

python
import requests
import pandas as pd

# Example for downloading user data
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/users')
user_data = response.json()

# Creating a DataFrame and saving to CSV
users_df = pd.DataFrame(user_data)
users_df.to_csv('users.csv', index=False)

# Example for downloading repository data
response = requests.get('https://api.example.com/repositories')
repo_data = response.json()

# Creating a DataFrame and saving to CSV
repos_df = pd.DataFrame(repo_data)
repos_df.to_csv('repositories.csv', index=False)


#### Step 3: Data Management

After successfully downloading the data, I used additional Python scripts to manage and analyze the CSV files. With pandas, I performed various operations, including:

- *Data Cleaning:* Identifying and removing duplicates or irrelevant entries.
- *Data Transformation:* Normalizing certain fields for consistency (e.g., converting date formats).
- *Data Analysis:* Conducting exploratory data analysis (EDA) to gain insights into user and repository trends.

python
# Load the data from CSV files
users_df = pd.read_csv('users.csv')
repos_df = pd.read_csv('repositories.csv')

# Data cleaning example
users_df.drop_duplicates(subset='user_id', inplace=True)

# Analyzing data
summary = users_df.describe()
print(summary)


#### Conclusion

This structured approach to data collection and management using Python scripts in VS Code allowed for efficient data handling and analysis. By automating the download and storage process, I ensured that the data was readily accessible for further exploration and decision-making.# tdsproject

Correlation: 0.077
Regression Estimate for Additional Followers:

This would typically require performing a regression analysis. If you found a slope of, say, X (you’d need to run the regression to get this value), it would tell you how many additional followers a user gains per additional public repository.
If you need help with the regression analysis or interpreting any of the findings, let me know!
